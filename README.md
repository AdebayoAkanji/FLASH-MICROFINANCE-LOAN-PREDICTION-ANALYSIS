 Story of Data
The data used for this analysis is downloaded from Kaggle.com. according to Kaggle.com the dataset is a private dataset.

Data Structure
The data structure has the column representing different variables such as Age, Gender, Marital Status, Region, State, Profession and Income, while the rows represent different customers.
The important features in this loan prediction analysis include the profession, marital status, and income. The income and profession are very important in determining whether or not the customer is eligible for a loan. The Marital Status also assist us to determine loan eligibility. 
After observing the data manually, I discovered that the data was inconsistent as the loan applicant's name was not there. However, there was no missing data in a cell, and no missing rows that needed cleaning. I also checked if data was duplicated in the dataset but no Data duplicate was discovered.

Data Splitting and Preprocessing

Data cleaning
Having checked and manually observed the data set, I discovered that the dataset was consistent. There was no missing data in a cell, and no missing rows that needed cleaning. I also checked if data was duplicated in the dataset but no Data duplicate was discovered.
I then converted the dataset to a standard excel table for accuracy and easy automation.
I now Split the data into category 1 which is independent values and category 2 dependent values for the reliability and effectiveness of that analysis.
Data transformation
There was a data transformation with the dataset I worked with and that includes adding variables like customer names to the dataset.

Potential Insights
We want to determine the highest paying profession to aid access to higher loan amounts.
To know the city applying for loan so we can establish an easy access loan point for them 
We can also determine the state that patronizes these services well in order to create more branches in the states.
We also need to know if the customers are responsible, that’s the reason for requesting their type of apartment. Those with rented apartments will have no landed properties as collateral and that may affect their access to getting a loan. However, this set of customers are not owners of houses as collateral, some of them own cars and some other properties which could afford them a dimension of loan.
There is a dimension of commitment from a customer with house ownership and car ownership as they are more eligible for a loan than a customer without any collateral for a loan.
 
Data Visualizations & Charts

West_Bengal is the state that is likely to get the highest number of customers granted loan from the analysis.




In terms of marital status single customers are likely to get loans much more than the married measuring with the other indices or dataset information. Even though most of the married people have double income based on the fact that the two partners are employed with a job thus the married are more stable financially than the single. However, the singles  are likely to get loan approval compared to married customers because the married customer have much responsibilities than the single in-spite of their double income. So the married has higher risk than the singles with little or no responsibilities.

This is because people who rent apartments have shown responsibility in paying for their rented house, especially those who have stayed long in an apartment.

Recommendation and Observation

I was able to determine from the analysis that the highest paying profession attracts higher eligibility for loan. Not just approval but also for higher loan amounts. I Also realised that cities with higher pay in the different professions have a high number of customers. This means such cities with higher levels of patronage should have more outlets of the loan organization to promote accessibility of the loan facility. We can also determine the state that patronizes these services well in order to create more branches in the states.

I was able to determine how responsible customers are, in terms of loan repayment, by requesting their housing type. I discovered that customers with rented apartments have a higher loan approval than those with owned apartments according to this analysis. Though we could say that customers with owned apartments are much more stable financially thereby a lot of them do not apply for loans. A divergent view is that customers with rented apartments, especially the ones who have lived long in a particular rented apartment, have shown commitment in paying rents. Meaning this attitude brings about likelihood of loan repayment. 

From the analysis software developer is the highest paid profession. Thus the eligibility to get a loan from the organization is more. Besides, the possibility of getting a higher loan amount is also guaranteed to a level as it is clear that they are well paid in their profession. Customers with high income can be afforded higher amount of loan based on their income, this will encourage high interest rate as income for the loan organization. The high income earners by profession should be encouraged by awareness and advertisement to get the loan facilities. Some attractive incentives can be introduced among the well paid customers to encourage their patronage. Also the access to the loan facility should be made easier to encourage them. 

In terms of marital status single customers are likely to get loans much more than the married measuring with the other indices or dataset information. Most of the married people have double income based on the fact that the two partners are employed with a job thus the married are more stable financially than the single. They are likely to get loan approval compared to married customers because the married customer have much responsibilities than the married in spite of their double income. So the married has higher risk than the singles with little or no responsibilities.

If closely observed married customers can receive higher approval of getting a loan because of their double and stable financial stands but based on the responsibilities of the married, it's a high risk when it comes to repayment.

Based on this analysis people who rent apartments are more eligible than people who own an apartment and norent_noown. This is because people who rent apartments have shown responsibility in paying for their rented house, especially those who have stayed long in an apartment. This in the long run affected their loan eligibility positively. 

This is also to show that customers with an owned apartment are more financially stable than those with a rented apartment. 

Conclusion
In conclusion, through this loan prediction analysis using Microsoft Excel, we’ve gained valuable insights into the factors that influence loan approval decisions. By leveraging Excel’s tools, such as pivot tables, and its data visualization features, we identified key variables like applicant income, applicant profession, house type and marital status that play a major role in determining outcomes.
